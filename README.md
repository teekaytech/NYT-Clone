In this project, our aim here wasn’t to produce an exact replica of the New York Times news page, but rather to focus on how to use positioning declarations in CSS. That means two things – laying out the basic structure of the page using semantic HTML elements and ensuring that the elements are appropriately sized and positioned.

There are many elements on the New York Times page which are produced with Javascript but our objective in this project wasn't to give this page functionality, so except from a portion of the content where a youtube video is embedded, nothing nothing else is clickable.

## Built with
  * HTML 
  * CSS (Box Model, Float, Grid, Flex and Positioning)

## Getting started
**For this project, we tried our best to recreate the New York Times web page. The main aim is to ensure the elements get placed and styled roughly the same way as the New York Times page, so functionality is not a priority.**

We used the browser’s developer tools to inspect the real New York Times page to understand how elements are placed and styled.
We built our own page in a .html text file and opened it in our browser to check it out. We carried out the following steps:
  - First setup a github repository for the project.
  - Then create a .html file where all our HTML markup will go
  - Create a .css file where all our styling code will reside
  - Then open the New York Times web page on https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0, inspect its features with your browser's developer tools and start creating  :shipit:
